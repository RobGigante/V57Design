      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Northern New Jersey watching my father work magic with his tools, and I caught the bug for making things with my hands from him. He could fix anything—and more importantly, he had the patience and curiosity to try, fail, and try again until he figured it out.</p>
      <p>That same spirit has guided me ever since. I’ve spent years building furniture, shelves, and decorative pieces for family and friends—always chasing that quiet satisfaction that comes from turning an idea into something real.</p>
      <p>After four decades delivering IT solutions in the corporate world, I’ve traded keyboards for a table saw and CNC machine. Today, I craft custom pieces that combine traditional craftsmanship with clean, modern design—built with care, patience, and attention to detail.</p>
      <p>Every project is personal. Whether it’s a one-of-a-kind accent piece or a larger installation, my goal is to create work that feels grounded, timeless, and made to last.</p>
